# Fix: Make.com "Request path contains unescaped characters" Error

## 🚨 **Error Explanation**

The "Request path contains unescaped characters" error occurs when:
- Facebook post content contains special characters (smart quotes, em dashes, control characters)
- Image URLs contain invalid characters or encoding issues
- Airtable data has formatting that Make.com can't process

## 🔧 **Immediate Fixes Applied**

I've updated your system to automatically clean data before sending to Make.com:

### 1. **Data Sanitization**
- Removes control characters (`\u0000-\u001F`, `\u007F-\u009F`)
- Replaces smart quotes (`""''`) with regular quotes (`"`)
- Replaces em/en dashes (`–—`) with regular dashes (`-`)
- Replaces ellipsis (`…`) with three dots (`...`)

### 2. **URL Validation**
- Validates image URLs before sending
- Removes invalid URLs that could cause errors

### 3. **Enhanced Debug Tools**
- New "🔍 Debug" button shows both original and cleaned data
- Identifies problematic characters before they reach Make.com

## 🧪 **How to Test the Fix**

### Step 1: Use Debug Button
1. **Refresh your dashboard** to get the updated code
2. **Go to "To Publish" → "Generated Content"**
3. **Find content with "Ready to Publish" status**
4. **Click "🔍 Debug" button**
5. **Check console** for:
   - Original data
   - Cleaned data
   - Any problematic characters found

### Step 2: Test Publishing
1. **Select Facebook platform** on a content item
2. **Click "Publish Now"**
3. **Check Make.com execution** - should no longer get unescaped character errors

## 🔍 **Common Problematic Characters**

### Smart Quotes
- `"` → `"`
- `"` → `"`
- `'` → `'`
- `'` → `'`

### Dashes
- `–` (en dash) → `-`
- `—` (em dash) → `-`

### Other Special Characters
- `…` (ellipsis) → `...`
- Control characters (invisible) → removed

## 🛠️ **Make.com Configuration Updates**

### Option 1: Add Error Handler (Recommended)
1. **Right-click on the Airtable module** in Make.com
2. **Add "Error Handler" → "Resume"**
3. **Add Airtable "Update Record" module**
4. **Set fields**:
   ```
   Publish_Status: "Failed"
   Publishing_Notes: "Error: {{error.message}} at {{now}}"
   ```

### Option 2: Use Text Functions in Make.com
Add these functions to clean data in Make.com:
```
{{replace(replace(1.Facebook_Post; """; """"); """; """)}}
```

## 📋 **Troubleshooting Steps**

### If Error Persists:

1. **Check Debug Output**
   - Look for remaining problematic characters
   - Verify URLs are valid

2. **Test with Simple Content**
   - Try plain text without special characters
   - Remove images temporarily

3. **Check Airtable Data**
   - Look for hidden characters in Facebook post content
   - Verify image URLs are accessible

### Manual Content Cleaning:
If you need to manually clean content in Airtable:
1. **Copy Facebook post content to a text editor**
2. **Replace smart quotes with regular quotes**
3. **Replace em dashes with regular dashes**
4. **Remove any unusual spacing or characters**

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

After the fix, you should see:
- ✅ No more "unescaped characters" errors in Make.com
- ✅ Debug button shows clean data
- ✅ Facebook posts publish successfully
- ✅ Make.com execution history shows success

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the debug button** to see what characters were problematic
2. **Try publishing again** - should work without errors
3. **Add error handler in Make.com** for future issues
4. **Monitor Make.com execution logs** for any remaining issues

## 📞 **If Still Having Issues**

The debug button will show you exactly what's causing the problem. Common remaining issues:
- **Invalid image URLs** - check if images are publicly accessible
- **Very long content** - Facebook has character limits
- **Special encoding** - some characters might need different handling

Run the debug button and share the console output if you need further help!
